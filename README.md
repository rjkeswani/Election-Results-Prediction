# Election-Results-Prediction

Dataset: Election_Data.xlsx \
Language Used: Python \
IDE used: Jupyter Notebook \
Report: Report.docx \
\
Problem Statement: To predict for which party an individual is going to vote in order to predict the election result on the basis of questions answered by the individual in an exit poll survey.
\
Problem Type: Classification (Biclass) \
\
Summary: \
-> Data was read using pandas. \
-> Statistical Analysis and Data cleanup was done i.e. null value check and duplicacy removal. \
-> Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis was done and insights were drawn. \
-> Outlier treatment, encoding for categorical variables, scaling was done. \
-> Data was split into 70:30 ratio for training and testing. \
-> Multiple classification models were built such as Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. \
-> Hyper-parameter tuning was done to improve model performance by doing grid search. \
-> Performance across various models was compared on the metrics such as Accuracy and ROC AUC score. \
-> Insights were drawn from the built model and presented.
